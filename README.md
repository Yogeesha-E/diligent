Create a complete technical architecture document for an e-commerce website using React.js with React Router for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas for the database. The website should allow users to explore products, view detailed product information, and manage a shopping cart. The backend should be lightweight, the frontend should have a clean and responsive UI, and state management should be handled efficiently using Context API or Redux. Include a high-level architecture diagram, frontend component structure, API endpoint design, database schema, data flow, and security and scalability considerations.

Build a Node.js and Express.js backend for the e-commerce website with RESTful APIs for products and cart operations. Integrate MongoDB using Mongoose, and create a product model with fields like name, description, price, image, category, and stock. Add a cart model for managing shopping cart items. Implement error handling, validation, and CORS configuration for frontend integration. Follow the MVC architecture pattern to keep the backend modular and maintainable.

Create the frontend using React.js with React Router for navigation between Home, Products, Product Details, and Cart pages. Implement product listing, product detail, and cart management components. Use Context API for state management and ensure a responsive UI using CSS. Integrate the frontend with backend APIs using Axios and design a clean, modern interface with product cards and a shopping cart system that allows users to add, update, and remove items.

Implement product-related components including a ProductCard component to display image, name, price, and an Add to Cart button, a ProductList component to render a responsive grid layout of product cards, and a ProductDetail component to show full product descriptions, price, and stock information. Connect all these components with backend APIs for dynamic data loading.

Create shopping cart functionality using React Context for global state management. Add CartItem and CartSummary components to display cart items and the total amount. Include features to add, update, and remove cart items. Make the cart persistent using localStorage or backend API integration so that the user’s cart is saved even after reloading the page.

Design a clean and responsive UI for the entire website. Use a mobile-first approach with consistent typography, spacing, and card-based layouts. Create a navigation bar with a dynamic cart icon and item count. Ensure that the product grid adjusts to different screen sizes, and design a simple, functional cart page for managing products.

Design MongoDB schemas for the Products and Cart collections using Mongoose. Define validation for all fields and generate sample data for development and testing. Create RESTful API documentation listing all endpoints, including their request and response formats, example payloads, and error handling structure. Add authentication requirements if needed and provide API testing instructions.

Generate package.json files for both frontend and backend with all required dependencies and scripts for development and production. Set up .env configuration templates containing MongoDB Atlas connection strings and environment variables for local and deployment setups. Provide step-by-step instructions for starting both frontend and backend servers in development mode.

Create a comprehensive README file containing the project overview, key features, tech stack details, installation and setup guide, usage instructions, and folder structure. Include details for contributing and testing. Implement proper error handling across the entire project including backend middleware for API errors, database error handling, and frontend user-friendly error messages.

Generate sample product data for testing purposes. The data should include multiple categories, realistic product names, descriptions, prices, placeholder images, and stock quantities. Ensure the data can be inserted into MongoDB for testing product display and cart operations.

Optimize the React frontend by applying memoization where required, reducing unnecessary state updates, implementing lazy loading for images, and minimizing bundle size. Optimize the Express.js backend by improving database query performance, enabling response compression, adding caching strategies, and applying rate limiting for secure and efficient API performance.
